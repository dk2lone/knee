# Progress

Where the score is, what is running, what happens next. Updated 14 Aug 2026, 21:30 EDT.

| | |
|---|---|
| Public leaderboard | **0.895** |
| Tenth place | 0.936 |
| Best public notebook | 0.916 |
| Final submission | 22 Oct 2026 |
| Submissions | 5 per day, the count resets 20:00 EDT |

The calibration that makes local numbers usable: **gold-58 macro + 0.044 ≈ leaderboard**.
So 0.936 needs a gold-58 of about 0.892, against 0.856 for the public members today.

## Running now

| What | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Parity run — 5 folds, 22 epochs, 12 slices, DINOv2-small at 8e-6 | Modal `fc-01M01EE15N0Q5BDPJJ86RH11TS` | training |
| `knee-blend` v3 — the members plus the RadImageNet arm | Kaggle | running |

Check them with `cloud/launch.py status <fc-id>` and `kaggle kernels status dk2lone/knee-blend`.
`modal app logs knee-train` is read-only and safe; **a `modal run` against that app cancels
its other inputs**, so never launch one while a sweep is alive.

## Runs

| # | submission | public LB | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | constant 0.5 | 0.500 | the benchmark the efficiency metric divides by |
| 2 | public baseline, unchanged | 0.891 | 20 members × 10 TTA windows |
| 3 | baseline, `TTA_OVERLAP=False` | 0.888 | 20 members × 4 windows |
| 4 | baseline, top 5 members | 0.891 | 2.4× faster for the same score |
| 5 | own model, r336 | 0.831 | one fold, 3 slices, holdout 0.8084 |
| 6 | 5 members + focal max pooling | **0.895** | free at inference (#30) |

Cutting the ensemble from 20 members to 5 costs nothing — the members differ only by fold
and seed, so votes 6-20 carry nothing. Dropping TTA windows costs more than dropping
fifteen members, which inverts the baseline's own stated priority.

## Per label, on the 58 gold studies

The number that decides where the remaining score is. Ours is `knee-train-v1`, one fold at
3 slices; the public column is the 20-member package scored under **its own** fold map
(the report hash — our site-grouped map leaks and returns 0.99). Issue #35.

| label | ours | public 20 | RadImageNet arm | teacher |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Lateral Meniscus | 0.604 | **0.660** | 0.722 | 0.879 |
| Lateral OA | — | **0.706** | 0.812 | 0.833 |
| Synovitis | — | 0.757 | 0.768 | 0.790 |
| PF OA | 0.728 | 0.826 | 0.802 | 0.902 |
| Medial Meniscus | 0.689 | 0.876 | 0.772 | 0.948 |
| ACL | 0.835 | 0.892 | 0.874 | 0.987 |
| MCL | — | 0.899 | 0.864 | 0.968 |
| Contusion | — | 0.870 | 0.901 | 0.860 |
| Baker's | — | 0.950 | 0.899 | 0.944 |
| Medial OA | — | 0.966 | 0.949 | 0.932 |
| Effusion | — | 0.953 | 0.907 | 0.877 |
| Fracture | — | 0.921 | 0.835 | 0.793 |
| **mean** | 0.765 | **0.856** | 0.842 | 0.893 |

Three things follow. **Lateral Meniscus and Lateral OA are the holes** — the whole public
field is 0.22 and 0.13 below the teacher there, and nobody has taken either. **The labels
are not the constraint**: summed over the seven labels where the teacher still leads, the
gap is +0.69, which is +0.058 macro, more than the +0.041 that separates this repo from
tenth. And the public package is not site-grouped, so its holdout is optimistic by
whatever site memorisation is worth.

## The plan to tenth

0.936 needs +0.041. Four steps, each measured before the next one is trusted. The gains
are what has already been measured somewhere, not hopes.

### 1. The RadImageNet arm — running, worth about +0.025

Priced offline from the publisher's own OOF table and bootstrap: +0.024 to +0.034 gold
macro over the same base this repo blends. **The checkpoint is CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0** — it buys
rank and may cost prize eligibility (#26, unanswered at discussion/735121).

```
kaggle kernels status dk2lone/knee-blend      # wait for COMPLETE
# browser: Submit to Competition
```

Success is about 0.92. Below 0.90 the arm did not run — read the log for "RadImageNet arm
skipped", which is the fail-safe reporting itself rather than a bad blend.

### 2. Our own members join the vote — worth about +0.010

The parity run is five folds, 22 epochs, 12 slices, at the configuration four sweeps
agree on. Its members vote beside the public ones, and they are **site-grouped**, so their
errors are not the public members' errors.

```
cloud/launch.py status fc-01M01EE15N0Q5BDPJJ86RH11TS
.venv/bin/python cloud/export.py --run full          # pull, check, push to Kaggle
# then add dk2lone/knee-members-full to WEIGHT_PACKAGES in eda/build_kernels.py
.venv/bin/python eda/build_kernels.py && kaggle kernels push -p kaggle/blend
```

**Gate it at 0.84 holdout.** B3 at 0.834 dragged 0.895 down to 0.891: a weak member is
dilution, not diversity (#29).

### 3. The slice band — untested, and the cheapest thing left

`SLICE_BAND = (0.20, 0.80)` throws away the outer 40% of every stack. **The lateral
meniscus and the lateral compartment live in those slices.** It is the one preprocessing
constant nobody has challenged, and the field's per-label numbers point straight at it:
the RadImageNet arm reads (0.12, 0.88) and beats every DINOv2 member on exactly the two
labels the band would cut — Lateral OA by +0.106 and Lateral Meniscus by +0.062.

Resolution is not the explanation. 130 mm over 336 px is 0.387 mm/px, already finer than
the acquisition, so a tighter crop would upsample rather than resolve.

One sweep, three arms, one fold, eight epochs, in one container:

```
# arms: band (0.20,0.80) control | (0.10,0.90) | (0.02,0.98)
.venv/bin/python -m modal deploy cloud/train.py
.venv/bin/python cloud/launch.py bands small 8 4
```

If a wider band lifts Lateral Meniscus, it lifts it for every member and costs nothing at
inference. Closing half of that label's gap to its teacher is +0.009 macro on its own.

### 4. The specialist — the part nobody has published

Whatever step 3 finds, Lateral Meniscus at 0.660 and Lateral OA at 0.706 stay the two
worst labels on the public frontier, against teachers of 0.879 and 0.833. A model trained
on those two findings alone, blended per label with the generalist, is the only remaining
+0.02 that is not already on Kaggle. Build it after step 3 says what the pixels should be.

### Where that lands

| after | expected |
|---|---|
| now | 0.895 |
| 1 | ~0.920 |
| 2 | ~0.930 |
| 3 | ~0.935 |
| 4 | 0.94+ |

## What is settled, so it is not re-run

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Adapt the encoder harder? | No. 8e-6 over 6 blocks wins; 1e-4 over 12 collapses (#33) |
| A bigger or medical encoder? | No. BioMedCLIP loses by 0.005 at the right rate; RAD-DINO is chest X-ray (#33) |
| More epochs? | No. 25 did not beat 10 (#31) |
| More slices? | Yes, modestly. 12 beats 6 by +0.006 (#33) |
| A second architecture? | Only a strong one. B3 at 0.834 hurt; the RadImageNet arm helps (#29, #35) |
| Site-grouped folds? | Right, and nearly free. The site probe scores 0.519 (#15) |
| An uncertainty policy for the weak labels? | No. All five CheXpert policies cross zero |
| Can the CLI submit? | No. This is a code competition; submitting is a button on the notebook page |
| Can a Modal Volume hold the corpus? | No. 570 GB breaks it; the corpus lives on ephemeral disk (#32) |

## Where the rest is

| [docs/competition.md](docs/competition.md) | the task, the format, the timeline, the prizes, the rules |
| [docs/data.md](docs/data.md) | the corpus, the DICOM headers, what the data description gets wrong |
| [docs/labels.md](docs/labels.md) | the 58 gold studies, the severity thresholds, where the reports go silent |
| [docs/field.md](docs/field.md) | site leakage, competitor claims, the leaderboard, public notebooks |
| [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) | the long-form context: what was measured overnight and what was retracted |
| [issues](https://github.com/dk2lone/knee/issues) | live state — what is happening and what closes it |
| [eda/](eda/) | every measurement here, as a runnable script |
| [kaggle/](kaggle/), [cloud/](cloud/) | the kernels, and the Modal chain that trains them |

## Submitting

```
kaggle kernels push -p kaggle/<name>          # upload and run
kaggle kernels status dk2lone/<id>            # wait for COMPLETE
# browser: ... menu -> Submit to Competition -> version -> Submit
kaggle competitions submissions -c rsna-knee-abnormality-detection
```

`kaggle competitions submit -f` returns a bare 400. Kaggle only accepts a submission that
came from a notebook run, because that is how the 9 h cap and the internet-off rule are
enforced. A failed upload costs no submission slot.
